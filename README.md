# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the use of sound engineering principles, methods and tools that can be used to produce high quality software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering the machine
mastering the process
mastering the complexity 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
user needs and expectations where you look at the problem you want to solve 
                  analysis 
problem statement where you have identified the problem and how you will solve it
                  design
detailed design where you come up with the design of the software that will be used to solve the problem
                  implementation
software product where you have an end product that makes peoples day to day lives easy 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a stricter and more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from a project plan while agile gives teams a margin of flexibilty 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
